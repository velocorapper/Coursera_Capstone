My client would like to open a high-end fitness centre, similar to the Adelaide club or the granite club. What we are looking for is an area with low existing gym density, particularly high end in an area with above average income.

I will use 2016 statistics Canada census data.

https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=FSA&Code1=V5Y&Geo2=PR&Code2=01&Data=Count&SearchText=V5Y&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&B1=All

This gives income by FSA as well as number of households and individuals (and adults). This in combination with foursquare will give us an idea of where there is an opportunity for a high end fitness centre.
